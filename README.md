--Horiseon Advertisment--

I have updated the source code of this advertisment with semantic elements and shortened the CSS style sheet in an attempt to make the code easier for developers to read and improve moving forward whilst making the website more accseible to people with disabilities.

I acheived this by:
<br>
-Adding a title to index.html
<br>
-Adding navigation, section, and aside elements to index.html
<br>
-Reordering the header elements
<br>
-Adding alternate attributes to the images on index.html
<br>
-Combining redundancies in the CSS
<br>
-Increasing some font sizes so the website is a bit easier to read
<br>
-Adding a color palette to the logo that I find reminiscent of a beautiful sunrise on the open ocean
